A fun app to browse Pokemon and add them to your collection. A user may add up to 5 Pokemon to bring with them into battle. Wins and losses are persisted in your account. When the battle is over you get a rundown of who won and the Pokemon left standing. I had an absolute blast making this with Flask. Give it a try and please contact me if you come across any errors!

Also, the Deployment branch is specifically designed for deploymeny through Render. The main branch will run locally on your machine if you decide to clone/fork, although you'd need the Database connection string. Contact me!

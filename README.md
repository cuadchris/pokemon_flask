A fun app to browse Pokemon and add them to your collection. A user may add up to 5 Pokemon to bring with them into battle. Wins and losses are persisted in your account. When the battle is over you get a rundown of who won and the Pokemon left standing. I had an absolute blast making this with Flask. Give it a try and please contact me if you come across any errors!
